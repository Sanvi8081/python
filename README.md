Learning Python step by step with daily GitHub commits...

# Day 1: Variables & Data Types 🐍

This folder contains basic Python examples to understand variables and built-in data types.

## Topics Covered

* Variables
* Integer, Float
* String
* Boolean

## Topics Covered

if-elif-else conditional statements

Single-line if (ternary operator)

clever if (ternary operator)

### Code Overview
1. Grade System

Assigns grades to a student based on marks obtained.

2. Ternary Operator Examples

Checks if the subject is accounts

Prints results using single-line conditional expressions

3. Salary Tax Calculation

Calculates tax based on salary using a compact conditional expression:

10% tax for salary ≤ 50,000

20% tax for salary > 50,000

## Day 3: Operators & Type Conversion 🐍

This folder contains basic Python examples to understand operators and type conversion.

## Topics Covered

Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /)

Assignment Operators

Comparison Operators

Logical Operators

Type Conversion

int(), float(), str()

Practice Programs 🧠💻
Practice Program 1: Sum of Two Numbers
Practice Program 2: Area of a Square


# Day 4: String Functions 🐍

This day focuses on understanding **Python strings** and commonly used **string methods**.

## Topics Covered
- String basics
- `endswith()`
- `capitalize()`
- `replace()`
- `find()`
- `count()`
- String formatting

## Practice
- Check string endings
- Modify and replace words
- Find characters in a string
- Count word occurrences

📌 These concepts help in text processing and data handling in Python.

## Day 5: Lists & Tuples 🐍
📌 Overview

Learned how to work with Lists and Tuples in Python, including slicing, methods, and basic problem-solving.

## Topics Covered
Lists

List creation

List slicing (positive & negative indexing)

append()

insert()

reverse()

sort() (ascending & descending)

Copying lists

Tuples

Tuple creation

count() method

Immutable nature of tuples

🧪 Practice

Performed list slicing on fruits list

Used list methods (append, insert, reverse, sort)

Took user input and stored values in a list

Checked if a list is a palindrome

Counted occurrences of "A" grade in a tuple

💡 Key Takeaways

Lists are mutable (can be changed).

Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed).

sort() works only with lists.

count() works with both lists and tuples

Day 6: Sets 🐍
📌 Overview

Learned how to work with Sets in Python, including set creation, set methods, and set operations like union and intersection.

📚 Topics Covered
🔹 Set Basics

Creating a set using { }

Removing duplicate values automatically

Checking the type using type()

Creating an empty set using set()

🔹 Set Methods

add() → Add an element

remove() → Remove a specific element

pop() → Remove a random element

clear() → Remove all elements

🔹 Set Operations

union() → Combine two sets

intersection() → Find common elements

🔹 Special Case Practice

Storing 9 and 9.0 separately in a set

Using built-in data types (tuples) to differentiate values
